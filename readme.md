# RussianRailroads

## Overview
This is an application for running a game of Russian Railroads ([BoardGameGeek](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/144733/russian-railroads)) by Helmut Ohley and Leonhard Orgler.

It is developed to be used for "play by forum" games where players take turns posting which move they will make. The application produces output that can be posted to show the state of the board. The format was inspired the one used by user junesen on the game played [here](http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1144834/game-1).

The application currently includes a subset of the actions, only those that advance black tracks.

The application prints a simplified version of the board, showing the action spaces and the progress of each players tracks.
