# RussianRailroads

## Overview
This is an application for running a game of Russian Railroads ([BoardGameGeek](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/144733/russian-railroads)) by Helmut Ohley and Leonhard Orgler.

It was developed to be used for "play by forum" games where players take turns. The application produces output that can be posted to show the state of the board. The format was inspired the one used by user junesen on the game played [here](http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1144834/game-1).
